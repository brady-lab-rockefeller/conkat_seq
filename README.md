# CONKAT-seq 

CONKAT-seq (co-occurrence network analysis of targeted sequences) is targeted sequencing workflow that enables the exploration of rare biosynthetic gene clusters in complex metagenomes. CONKAT-seq is designed to reconstruct the clustered organization of biosynthetic domains in the metagenome based on the statistical analysis of amplicon co-occurrences in a partitioned library of large insert metagenomic clones. Briefly, high molecular weight DNA from soil samples are extracted and cloned to construct large insert metagenomic library which preserves the linkage between co-clustered genes. Library clones are randomly partitioned into hundreds of wells (subpools), and DNA sequence encoding for biosynthetic domains of interest are amplified using barcoded primers. Amplicon de-barcoding identifies the positioning of each biosynthetic domain within the array of subpools and co-occurrence frequencies of biosynthetic domain variants across all subpools are recorded. Pairwise statistical analysis of domain co-occurrence (Fisherâ€™s exact test) identifies domain pairs that show strong linkage and is used to assign amplicon variants into distinct biosynthetic domain networks. Finally, CONKAT-seq predictions are visualized as networks, where nodes represent sequence variants of the targeted biosynthetic domains and edges link domains predicted to be physically co-clustered in the metagenomic DNA.

## <a name="howitworkds"></a> How it works

**CONKAT-seq** requires 3 processing steps to process subpool-demultiplexed amplicon sequencing data (FASTA format) to predicted networks of chromosomally co-clustered biosynthetic domains (GraphML format).

#### Pre-processing steps (repeat for every targeted domain amplicon dataset)
---
**Step 1: build_clustrering_table.py** 

Pre-processing (primer removal, length trimming, dereplication) of subpool-demultiplexed amplicon reads. 

Processed reads from all library subpools are clustered using VSEARCH implementation of the USEARCH algorithm. Each cluster contains a set of highly similar amplicon sequences (<95% identity) originating from one or more library subpools.

- input:
    1. Folder containing amplicon sequencing fasta file(s). Files must be demultiplexed according to subpool amplicon barcode.  
    For example, if the targeted domain amplification was performed on a 384 subpools library (i.e., 384 PCR reactions), the demultiplexed data will consist of 384 individual FASTA files representing each one subpool sample.
    
- output
    1. Domain amplicons clustering table in a UCLUST-format tabbed text format [sample_name.txt]
    2. Sequences of cluster centroids in a FASTA format	[sample_name.fna]

**Step 2: filter_clustrering_table.py** 

Parasing of the domain clustering table into a dataframe and filtering of domain variants with low read counts or low number of subpool occurrences.

- input
    1. Domain amplicons clustering table in a UCLUST-format tabbed text format [sample_name.txt]
    2. Sequences of cluster centroids in a FASTA format	[sample_name.fna]
       
- output
    1. Filtered domain clustering dataframe [sample_name.csv]

#### Network analysis (Once per metagenomic library. Can integrate multiple domain amplicon datasets.)
---
**Steps 3: conkat_seq.py**

Pairwise statistical analysis of pairwise domain co-occurrences. 

To identify pairs of biosynthetic domains that originate from physically clustered metagenomic DNA, a 2x2 contingency table (the number of subpools containing both domain variants, one of the two only, or none of them) is constructed for each pair of domain sequence variants the co-occurrence significance is computed using Fisher's exact test. Pairs of domains showing non-random association based on p-value cutoff value are predicted to be physically linked, and hence predicted to belong to the same gene cluster. Based on a pairwise list of statistically significant links a graph representation of domain networks is constructed, where nodes represent cluster of biosynthetic domains and edges link domains that are predicted to be physically co-clustered.

- input
    1. One or more filtered domain clustering dataframe [sample_name.csv]

- output
    1. Predicted networks of chromosomally co-clustered biosynthetic domains in a GraphML format [sample_name.graphml]

## <a name="Installation"></a> Installation and Dependencies 

CONKAT-seq is available for Linux and MacOS platforms and requires the installation of **[Python (v2.7.x)](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2716/)** and **[VSEARCH (v2.9.1+)](https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)**. 

In order to use "clear_host_reads" mode (removal of amplicons matching library host genome, usually E. coli) **[BBMap](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bbmap/)** and **[SAMTOOLS (v3.0.0+)](http://samtools.sourceforge.net/)** are needed to be in the user path.
